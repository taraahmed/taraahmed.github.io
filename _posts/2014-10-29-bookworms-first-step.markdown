<p>Gorwing up as an awkward, nerdy kid, I'd attached myself to the world of books, a place where I felt like I belonged. In the pages of Judy Blume, Meg Cabbot, and Jerry Spinelli's novels (to name a few), I felt a sense of completion that I didn't quite feel elsewhere.</p>

<p>There was a time when I was 12, reading a passage from one of my favorite books and thinking, "wow...I could never write like that".</p>

<p>It was this thought that kept me reading, but prevented me from sharing my writing with others. It was the fear of being judged, being laughed at, being 'not good enough'.</p>

<h2>Take a chance</h2>

<p>But then I turned 17, and I was at the age where I felt that taking a slight chance was necessary. When I wrote my first novella, I sent it to a close friend of mine. I felt comfortable sending it to her, because she was one of the few people, other than my parents, who I knew wouldn't judge. So when she replied back after reading the first chapter saying " I loved it!" - a rush of excitement moved through me.</p>

<p>From then on, I kept sending her chapters, and she kept reading, giving critical but encouraging feedback. It was freaking awesome!</p>

<p>But even thenn, I couldn't even bring myslef to show that story to anyone else. It still wasn't good enough...but the idea that I'd begun to do something I never thought I could...gave me hope.</p>

<p>Hope...that's an amazing feeling to have.</p>

<p>Anyways, after that chapter of my life, I'd put writing in the back seat, and focused on my studies at University.</p>

<p>Only in my sophmore year at college did I decide to change my major from Law to English Literature. Why?</p>

<p>Because...it felt right. As if it was my calling. My English professor were very encouraging as well, and it was then...right at my third year at college, that I decided to persue writing.</p>

<p>I didn't know whether I'd get very far, but I knew this much...I was chasing my dream, and that meant everything.</p>
