<p>From time to time, I will meet with potential writers, who ask a handful of questions in their quest to get published.  I love talking with other creative types, who have the same goal in mind.  I leave recharged and confirmed, while the hopeful writers I mentor are inspired to move forward.</p>

<p>When Tara asked me to contribute to her blog, I thought I'd share and answer some of the common questions that I most often hear.  So if you're a hopeful writer, read below for a few helpful Q&amp;A's that might aid in your journey.</p>

<h3>Q: "Do you recommend traditional publishing or self publishing?"</h3>

<p>A:  Although I have been with a traditional publisher, I have been converted to self publishing.  My first book, Finding Kylie, was published and released in 2006 by a small traditional publisher - but the experience was less than stellar.  This particular publisher not only stole every cent from my book sales but they stole from almost every one of their authors.</p>

<p>Needless to say, traditional publishers left a bad taste in my mouth.  I took a break from writing for a short time to decide what my next step would be.  At that point in the writing industry, self publishing had a bad stigma attached to it ... as 'those that couldn't get published traditionally went the self-pub route'.  However, an evolution occurred where savvy writers led the revolution saying enough was enough and they were loud enough that I listened and took action.</p>

<p>I became of the same mind of those who self-published in thinking, 'why should I share my revenue with anyone when I can do it myself?'  I create my covers, know some talented editors, and have a marketing degree, which gives me access to promote my own book.  On a second note, even if you go with a traditional publisher - they expect you to promote it mostly yourself anyways.</p>

<p>So - long answer to a short question ... I prefer to self-pub.  It gives any author direct control over your own project, and complete control over your income.</p>

<h3>Q: "How do I get from a character to a scene on a page?  I have character ideas and story ideas, but can't get it configured to make a story."</h3>

<p>A: Here's where an answer can get really subjective as there is no ONE right answer.  It will vary from writer to writer, but I can only answer what works for me.</p>

<p>I tell people to let their character simmer for a while.  Keep a journal nearby at all times and brainstorm.  As my author friend, Jan Morrill, will advise ... 'interview your character'.  Think about what they like and 'why'.  Dig deep within your character's personality and history to flesh them out.  </p>

<p>In your journal, name your protagonist and antagonist and supporting characters.  Write adjectives near their names, attaching attributes to them.  For example, if your character's name is Janz Howard, you may write next to his name: strong, silent, surly, mechanically inclined ... etc. </p>

<p>Once you start building your cast - insert them into a scene.  Think and write visually.  Do this first and a story line should start to submerge.</p>

<h3>Q: "Do I pay to get my writing published?"</h3>

<p>A: The answer is NEVER NEVER NEVER!  I didn't even insert commas in-between those words as I didn't hesitate and neither should you.  Do not hesitate to run from anyone, who asks you to offer up investments in your writing for 'marketing reasons' or 'administration fees'.  No matter what the reason, no one should charge you for anything.</p>

<p>These people are called vanity presses.  Companies that charge you are making their money off YOU.  You'll never re-coup your investment back.  To avoid scams, check this site often: <a href="http://pred-ed.com">Preditors &amp; Editors</a></p>

<p><i>(be warned - not every company is on this list, but they do a good job of listing most pitfalls.)</i></p>
