<p>At last, it’s complete! I congratulate you, dear writer, in doing what some only dream of.</p>

<p>After hours, days, weeks, months, and possibly years of writing your novel, it is complete. You have beaten yourself over this draft for as long as you can remember, so much so that the words “yeah, I’m still working on it”, have become a kind of slogan.</p>

<p>But finally, when you wrote that last sentence, to that ending chapter, a sense of rush flew through you. It was like a moment of euphoria, where you thought, “Wow…it’s DONE!”</p>

<p>Ah, but is it truly done?</p>

<p>As your eyes skim through that manuscript, you notice typos, grammatical errors, and honestly…bad writing.</p>

<p>It sucks.</p>

<p>All of it.</p>

<p>Every single part of your first draft, sucks, and the more you look at it, the more heinous it appears. Why, that dialogue shouldn’t be there! And where did that plot hole the size of Kansas come from? Most importantly, how the heck were you going to fix it?</p>

<p>Well, my friends…that’s where editing comes in.</p>

<p>Editing can either be your best friend, or that nagging aunt that visits you every once in a while poking her nose into your business.</p>

<p>I’m sure we’d all rather want the best friend, so the first thing we have to do…is embrace editing.</p>

<p>After you’ve done that, there are a few steps one must take.</p>

<h3>Step #1: The basics.</h3>

<p>Check all typos, spelling, and grammar. Get that out of the way first. You’ll thank yourself later.</p>

<h3>Step #2: RE READ</h3>

<p>Read through your entire novel, making sure it flows the way you want it. Re read it aloud as well.</p>

<h3>Step #3: Get feedback</h3>

<p>Have a beta read give feedback on your book, and with their advice, change or fix anything that’s needed.</p>

<h2>Happy Editing!</h2>
