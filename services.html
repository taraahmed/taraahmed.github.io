<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Tara Ahmed, I am a 24 year old BS English Literature graduate from Pace University, New York. Ever since I learnt to read and write, I have immersed myself in creative writing, reading and editing. I am an experienced writer and editor, and I am a published author.</p>
<h1>Why me?</h1>
<p>My rates are the lowest. I have performed research and could NOT find any service provider that charges less than me. If you have smaller pieces of writing that needs editing, then how does ¢1 per word sound?</p>
<p>The four 'I's.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I do not work for the money, I work out of passion.</li>
  <li>I always provide honest, reliable and high quality work and advice.</li>
  <li>I do not charge additional 'setup' or 'base' charges. The price you see is the price you pay.</li>
  <li>I am always on-call and can be contacted at any time.</li>
</ul>
