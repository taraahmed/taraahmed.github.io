<h1>Who am I?</h1>
<p>Hi! My name is Tara Ahmed, I am 24 year old BS English Literature graduate from Pace University, New York. Ever since I learnt to read and write, I have immersed myself in creative writing, reading and editing. I am an experienced writer, author and I have published my own novel.</p>
<h1>Why me?</h1>
<p>My rates are the lowest. I performed research and could NOT find any service provider that charges less than me.</p>
<ul>
  <li>I do not work for the money, I work out of passion (however, bill still amount).</dli>
  <li>I always provide honest, reliable and high quality work and advice.</li>
  <li>My services are all inclusive and I do not charge additional 'setup' or 'base' charges. The price you see is the price you pay.</li>
  <li>I am always on-call and can be contacted at any time.</li>
</ul>
